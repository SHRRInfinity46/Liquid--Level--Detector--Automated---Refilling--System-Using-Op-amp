# Liquid--Level--Detector--Automated---Refilling--System-Using-Op-amp
A Simulation of a circuit which can detect the liquid level and automatically refill the liquid level.
The Simulation is done in proteus 8.2.
Due to unavailability of Pressure sensor in proteus, used temparature sensor as equivalent of Pressure sensor.
